# dashtoon_task

A Flutter project to generate cartoon images using text prompts.

##overview
This project is a simple web application that allows users to create a 10-panel comic strip. The comic is generated by inputting text into a form, which is then sent to a text-to-image API using a provided API key. The application is developed using the Flutter framework and is also available as an Android app. The source code for the application can be found in the lib folder of the project repository. You can go to this folder to view the Dart files that make up the application.

##Live Demo
The application is hosted at [https://fir-integration-c6fab.web.app/]

##Code Structure
In the lib folder, you will find several Dart files each serving a specific purpose in the application:

-->homepage.dart: This file contains the implementation of the main page of the application. It includes the UI elements and the form for inputting text for the comic panels.
-->apirequest.dart: This file handles the API requests to the text-to-image API. It takes the userâ€™s input, sends it to the API, and handles the response.
-->image_card.dart: This file contains the implementation for the display area of the generated images. It takes the image data from the API response and displays it in the respective comic panel.
